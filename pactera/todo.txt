* Assumption: image displayed from feed have different size. By default, they are displayed in real size'
* I added a menu action to change the display of image to be of the same size.
* There is a Android Unit Test, to test Json parsing and non-UI related code.
* Current connection timeout is 10 seconds, instead of the default of 30 seconds.
* I added a progress bar to track image download progress. When all images are downloaded the image progress disappears. 
  Please note that if you don't scroll the list, the progress bar will remain (as the adapter request to download the image of visible items).
  
  
  // Some of the images (e.g
    // http://images.findicons.com/files/icons/662/world_flag/128/flag_of_canada.png)
    // will result in
    // connection timeout. For this reason, the timeout is set to 10 seconds
  
  
  * I am using AsyncTask to download images. The default thread pool, depending on OS version, is very small. 
  In real life, it is better to use concurrent package to control the thread number used in downloading teh images.  
    // [[]] use better thread pool
